These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage. As with the double expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low - pressure stage. Multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yaorrw - Schlick - Tweedy balancing ' sesytm ' was used on some marine triple eapxnsino enegnis. Y - S - T engines divided the low - pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better aacblned, rntugsiel in a smoother, faster - responding engnie which ran with less vibration. This made the 4 - cydnelir triple - expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the Olympic class ), but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration - free turbine engine.

The rotors have a propeller - leik arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts poun these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of baleds that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condersen that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized hghi - and low - pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship ' s propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating tistsona, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half ethse speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.

Common essu of oxygen includes the production cycle of steel, plastics and itetxles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, in oxygen therapy and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the term for the arrangement of two unpaired electrons in dioxygen?", "id": "571c879bdd7acb1400e4c0ec", "answers": [{"text": "spin triplet state", "answer_start": 363}, {"text": "spin triplet state", "answer_start": 363}, {"text": "spin triplet state", "answer_start": 363}, {"text": "spin triplet state", "answer_start": 363}, {"text": "a spin triplet state", "answer_start": 361}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How is the O2 molecule referred to in its ground state?

This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice ' s view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity blil to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law ccnfteolid with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU atrleic 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Urcot of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Tsujeci, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, aisd member states \" albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to tiher nationals and to themselves \" on the \" basis of reciprocity \". EU law would not \" be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed. .. without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question. \" This meant any \" subsequent unilateral act \" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \" accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law, \" sida the Court of Justice, the \" directly applicable measures of the institutions \" (such as the Regulations in the case) \" render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law \". Hits was necessary to prevent a \" corresponding denial \" of Treaty \" obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states \", that could \" imperil the very foundations of the \" EU.

According to the standard theory of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less predtcoivu economy in all respects. Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, tnhe union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear theerwh the \" endgame \" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice free trade, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some plpoee and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but will burden people who lack iarnibnagg epwor in an expanding market, particularly workers, consumers, small business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 estbialsh the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so - called \" four freedoms \" were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e. g. customs ), technical barriers (e. g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e. g. different Value Added Tax rates ). The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for uterenristcd commercial profit. The Treaties limit free trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer protection, labour ritghs, fair competition, and environmental improvement. Increasingly the Court of Justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for improvement of people ' s well being."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What did did article 34 discriminate against in Procureur du Roi v Dassonville?", "id": "5726b718dd62a815002e8dbf", "answers": [{"text": "parallel importers like Mr Dassonville", "answer_start": 851}, {"text": "parallel importers", "answer_start": 851}, {"text": "parallel importers", "answer_start": 851}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Article 34 meant states could be responsible for what?", "id": "5726b718dd62a815002e8dc0", "answers": [{"text": "private actors", "answer_start": 1247}, {"text": "private actors", "answer_start": 1247}, {"text": "private actors", "answer_start": 1247}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In which case were French vigilantes sabotaging shipments of Spanish Strawberries?", "id": "5726b718dd62a815002e8dc1", "answers": [{"text": "Commission v France", "answer_start": 1280}, {"text": "Commission v France French", "answer_start": 1280}, {"text": "Commission v France French", "answer_start": 1280}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In Schmidberger v Austria, the Court of Justice came to the conclusion that Austria didn't infringe upon article 34 by failing to ban a what?", "id": "5726b718dd62a815002e8dc2", "answers": [{"text": "a protest that blocked heavy traffic", "answer_start": 2394}, {"text": "a protest", "answer_start": 2394}, {"text": "a protest", "answer_start": 2394}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "duties", "answer_start": 173}], "question": "What is not prohibited between member states?", "id": "5ad15289645df0001a2d175b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "imports", "answer_start": 139}], "question": "What the the EU not manage from non-member states?", "id": "5ad15289645df0001a2d175c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "private actors", "answer_start": 1247}], "question": "What were states not responsible for in Article 34?", "id": "5ad15289645df0001a2d175d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Commission v France", "answer_start": 1280}], "question": "What case were French vigilantes helping shipments of Spanish Strawberries?", "id": "5ad15289645df0001a2d175e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non - discrimination. The EU manages imports from non - member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018 Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States \u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \" trading rules \" that are \" enacted by Member States \" which could hinder trade \" directly or indirectly, actually or potentially \" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of oirgin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \" wide test \", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi - government bodies, such as the former \" Buy Irish \" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018 manifestly and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that deltciry discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU arleitc 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications diculne public morality, policy or stceuiry, \" protection of health and life of humans, animals or tnalps \", \" national treasures \" of \" artistic, historic or archaeological value \" and \" industrial and commercial property. \" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic pasgnsi over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although anmy companies, including Mr Schmidberger ' s German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018 fundamental pillars of a democratic society \u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 asfuiticjtion, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the minimum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e8", "answers": [{"text": "25", "answer_start": 720}, {"text": "25 per cent", "answer_start": 720}, {"text": "25 per cent", "answer_start": 720}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which country did Rewe-Zentrale AG wish to import from?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e9", "answers": [{"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}, {"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}, {"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa products?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ea", "answers": [{"text": "2003", "answer_start": 1810}, {"text": "2003", "answer_start": 1810}, {"text": "2003", "answer_start": 1810}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "All Italian chocolate is made from what alone?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8eb", "answers": [{"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2031}, {"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2031}, {"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2031}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": " In the 2009 Commission v Italy, case, the Court of Justice held that an Italian low prohibiting what infringed article 34?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ec", "answers": [{"text": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers", "answer_start": 2597}, {"text": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers", "answer_start": 2597}, {"text": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers", "answer_start": 2597}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "25 per cent", "answer_start": 720}], "question": "What was maximum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1796", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}], "question": "Which country dod Rewe-Zentrale AG not wish to import from?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1797", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Court of Justice", "answer_start": 977}], "question": "Who accepted the German government's arguments that the measure proportional protected public health?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1798", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products. For such \" indirect \" discriminatory (or \" indistinctly applicable \") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \" mandatory \" or \" overriding \" requirements ushc as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe - Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol ncnteot of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. Garmne liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Ojidn, which Rewe - Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government ' s arguments that the marsuee proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stnrrego beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product ' s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \" coarisldnbey exceed the requirements of the object in view \" and labelling would protect consumers \" just as effectively \". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \" chocolate \". It had to be \" chocolate substitute \". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \" chocolate substitute \" label. This was derogatory in the consumers ' eyes. A \u2018 neutral and objective statement \u2019 was enough to protect cousrmnes. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the hntpbiioior would deter people from yuibng it: it would have \" a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers \" that \" affects the access of that product to the market \". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which two importers claimed that under a French competition law, they were prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf59", "answers": [{"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 293}, {"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 293}, {"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 293}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The aim of the French competition law was to do what?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf5a", "answers": [{"text": "cut throat competition", "answer_start": 500}, {"text": "prevent cut throat competition", "answer_start": 492}, {"text": "prevent cut throat competition", "answer_start": 492}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Under which Directive did the EU harmonize restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf5c", "answers": [{"text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "answer_start": 1881}, {"text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "answer_start": 1881}, {"text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "answer_start": 1881}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 293}], "question": "Which two importers did not claim that under French competition law, they were prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price?", "id": "5ad1556e645df0001a2d17da", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade", "answer_start": 489}], "question": "What was not the aim of the TFEU article 34 law?", "id": "5ad1556e645df0001a2d17dc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In contrast to pordctu requirements or other laws that hinder market access, the Court of Justice developed a presumption that \" snlielg arrangements \" would be presumed to not fall into TFEU article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected them in the same manner in fact. In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that ethir prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade. The Tcuro of Justice held, as \" in law and in fact \" it was an equally applicable \" selling arrangement \" (not something that alters a product ' s content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \" in fact \" particularly where traders from another beemmr state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Asoginti the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bnsa have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were \" the only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate \" the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers ' \" traditional social practices and to local habits and cmtuoss \" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was euistfijd under article 36 to protect public health. Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts aergave consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair. Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other ' s standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice.

Free movement was increasingly based on \" citizenship \", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \" worker \" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general ihgrts of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21.

In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer ndmae Jean - Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R. F. C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \" the transfer rules constitute [d] an obstacle to free movement \" and were unlawful unless they could be juisifdet in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By nortacst in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \" horizontal \" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \" mspbisiole to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means \", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7 (2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e. g. for married cpuleos, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who wkored in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel ' s claim that a re - registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \" likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement \", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \" social advantages \", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity eenbtfis when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \" closely linked to the cisoo - economic situation \" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein - Westfalen the Court of Justice ehdl that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full - time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45 (3) are \" public policy, public security or public health \", and there is also a general exception in article 45 (4) for \" employment in the public service \"."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What has lately been being viewed as a fundamental status of member state nationals by the Court of Justice?", "id": "5726bcde708984140094cfbf", "answers": [{"text": "Citizenship of the EU", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Citizenship of the EU", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Citizenship of the EU", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Citizenship of the EU", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What has not been seen increasingly as a fundamental status of member state nationals by the Court of Justice?", "id": "5ad158c0645df0001a2d1828", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Citizenship of the EU has increasingly been seen as a \" fundamental \" utstas of member state nationals by the Court of Justice, and has accordingly inercesad the number of social services that poelpe can access wherever they move.

However, the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were non - discriminatory, \" justified by imperative requirements in the general interest \" and proportionately applied. All people or entities that engage in economic activity, particularly the self - employed, or \" undertakings \" such as companies or firms, have a right to set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions. The Court of Justice has held that both a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment, so article 49 has both \" vertical \" and \" horizontal \" direct effect. In Rneyesr v Bgliuem the Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified. TFEU article 49 says states are exempt omfr infringing others ' freedom of establishment when hety exercise \" official authority \", but this did an advocate ' s work (as oespopd to a court ' s) was not official. By contrast in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that a requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction.

For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Ndahtrelnes could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets - Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets - Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a \" service \" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \" international medical science \" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK ' s National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sesiintve field of services are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands ' regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some cinuapimlstiei on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi - legal activity was subject to restriction. If an activity does fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi\u00ebn a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Nclyh and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that rhopibinitg cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \" undesirable developments in securities trading \" including protecting the consumer from arvgeissge sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a \" laserdrome \" business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against \" playing at killing \" entemtainrnet. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people ' s views were highly divergent. The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet.

This meant the Daily Mail newspaper ' s parent company could not evade tax by shifting its rdsnieece to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to fitsujy its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus - og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to cpyolm with Denmark ' s minimum share capital rules. UK law only required \u00a3 1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark ' s legislature took the view companies should only be started up if teyh had 200, 000 Danish krone (around \u20ac 27, 000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark ' s minimum apcltai law infringed Centros Ltd ' s freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive msnae of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bototm in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GhmB the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of icpacayt went too far: it was an \" outright negation \" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt the Court of Justice afdeimrf again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified ), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why."}]}, {"title": "Amazon_rainforest", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is the Dutch word for the Amazon rainforest?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9efe", "answers": [{"text": "Amazoneregenwoud", "answer_start": 157}, {"text": "Amazoneregenwoud", "answer_start": 157}, {"text": "Amazoneregenwoud", "answer_start": 157}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What rainforest covers the majority of the Amazon basin in South America?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9eff", "answers": [{"text": "The Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 4}, {"text": "The Amazon", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what country can most of the Amazon rainforest be found?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9f00", "answers": [{"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The Amazon rainforest makes up what amount of Earth's rainforests?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9f01", "answers": [{"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}, {"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}, {"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many nations are within the Amazon Basin?", "id": "5729e2316aef0514001550c6", "answers": [{"text": "nine nations", "answer_start": 525}, {"text": "nine", "answer_start": 525}, {"text": "nine", "answer_start": 525}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which nation contains the majority of the amazon forest?", "id": "5729e2316aef0514001550c7", "answers": [{"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Amazonia or the Amazon jungle are no longer used to refer to what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What covers most of the Amazon basin of Central America?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Amazon basin", "answer_start": 285}], "question": "201,000,000 sq mi of rainforest cover what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "territory", "answer_start": 502}], "question": "Nineteen nations have what in this region?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "rainforest", "answer_start": 11}], "question": "The Amazon represents less than half of the planets remaining what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The Amazon rainforest (Portuguese: Floresta Amaz\u00f4nica or Amaz\u00f4nia; Spanish: Selva Amaz\u00f3nica, Amazon\u00eda or usually Amaoanzi; French: For\u00eat amazonienne; Dutch: Amazoneregenwoud ), also known in English as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle, is a moist brdaoleaf frotse that coresv most of the Amazon basin of South America.

Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were evaynuellt brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis - eating Rnoth American ceenophtor Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal ' s metabolism.

Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria, and sister to all other animal phyla. A series of studies that loekod at the presence and absence of mmbesre of gene families and signalling pathways (e. g. , homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathwya, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other anlsmia. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e. g. , Porifera) or that teyh evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest - diverging animal phylum instead.

Instead he found ttha various cydippid filimeas were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid - like or beroid - like. A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and cocdluden that the stla common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid - like. It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small \u2013 so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida aermdnei uncertain.

But X. 25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another rajmo difference between X. 25 and Frame Relay is that X. 25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X. 25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user - network - interface (UNI ). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X. 25 does specify some limited re - transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC - type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN ' s layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity rpnoaitoes pertain only between nodes on a link, not end - to - end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by eighhr layer protocols. The X. 25 UNI protocol is part of the X. 25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet reowknts. Some implementations used X. 25 within the network as well, but its conneonict - oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inffeetcini. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X. 25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node - to - node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X. 25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X. 25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X. 25 its packet IDs - - - the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection - oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC / LAPD / LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM ). X. 25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection - oriented eadhshakn. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X. 25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi - Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP oerv ATM or a version of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X. 25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Nrktoews, McGraw - Hill, 1998> <Yusels Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> <Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995 >"}, {"qas": [{"question": "WHat does UserDatagram Protocol gaurentee", "id": "57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7d", "answers": [{"text": "In the virtual call system, the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host", "answer_start": 463}, {"text": "sequenced delivery of data to the host", "answer_start": 514}, {"text": "sequenced delivery of data", "answer_start": 514}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "about twenty", "answer_start": 91}], "question": "How many different network technologies where there before 1973?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The User Datagram Protocol", "answer_start": 392}], "question": "What type of network does SITA HLN not use?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "host interface", "answer_start": 580}], "question": "X.25 had a simpler what?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core", "answer_start": 236}], "question": "What defined the differences between the ARPANET and SITA HLN and X.25?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e18a0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "about twenty different network technologies had been developed", "answer_start": 91}], "question": "After the introduction of X.25 in 1973, how many network technologies had been developed?", "id": "5a6688fcf038b7001ab0bf6c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host", "answer_start": 491}], "question": "In UDP, the network guarantees what?", "id": "5a6688fcf038b7001ab0bf6d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "ARPANET and SITA HLN became operational in 9196.

The combined wealth of the \" 10 million dollar millionaires \" grew to nearly $ 41 trillion in 2008.

It has also allowed for the rapid spread of technologies and ideas. The term imperialism has been applied to Western (and Japanese) political and emconoic dominance eseaicplly in Asia and Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries. Its precise meaning continues to be debated by scholars.

The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the osioppng side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo - politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post - colonial world.

Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a drgeee of geographic separation between the cloyno and the mapeiril power.

The ertm \" Imperialism \" was originally intreoudcd into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \" imperialism \" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self - interest, and a growing number associated it wthi capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Mrtxsia theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \" imperialism \".

He distinguished between the inntae tendency of objects to find their \" natural place \" (e. g. , for heavy bodies to fall ), whihc led to \" natural motion \", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, bdesa on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the cttsaonn application of a ofcre needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows.

Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety edgeres to each other have no feefct on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will eamk the mathematics most convenient.

This standard model of ctariple physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation.
